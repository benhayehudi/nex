# Getting Started with Broadcasting Non-English SMS Messages with Rails and the Nexmo API   
*Ben Greenberg*

## Overview

In this article we are going to demonstrate how to create a Ruby on Rails application to broadcast SMS messages to a list of phone numbers. There is a multitude of use cases for broadcasting messages to employees, customers or clients. With the help of the Nexmo Ruby Gem and the Nexmo API we can easily create an application to accomplish this. We can leverage the built in Unicode support of the Nexmo API to send SMS messages in any language, including languages that are not based on English characters, like Hebrew, Mandarin or Arabic.

Let's get started!
